# Twig-Rust

a **template engine** for everyone writing web applications with Rust. By design Twig is
* flexible
* fast
* and secure

This library is derived from [Twig (for PHP)](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) and supposed to become a _fully compatible_ port.

## Current Status

> **EARLY ALPHA** - This library is still in development and not yet ready for use.

## License

Twig-Rust is released under the new BSD license (code and documentation) - as is the original Twig for PHP.

More Information
----------------

Twig uses a syntax similar to the Django and Jinja template languages which
inspired the Twig runtime environment.

Read the [official documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) for more information.
