!! Important: This is early alpha and not yet functional !!

Twig-Rust is (supposed to become) a port of the PHP-library Twig.
Twig-Rust is released under the new BSD license (code and documentation) - as is the original Twig.

More Information
----------------

Twig uses a syntax similar to the Django and Jinja template languages which
inspired the Twig runtime environment.

Read the `documentation`_ for more information.
